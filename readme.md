Developed an expense manager using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP, with CSS for design. The application allows users to track their expenses, categorize transactions, and visualize spending habits through interactive charts. PHP is used for backend data handling, ensuring secure storage and retrieval. This project showcases my skills in web development, UI design, and database management.
